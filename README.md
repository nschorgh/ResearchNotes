  Derivation of invariant parameters for surface temperatures of
  airless body

  Thermal inertia and thermal diffusivity are invariants of the
  one-dimensional heat equation with Stefan-Boltzmann Law boundary
  condition. Here, a formal derivation is given, along with a
  correction to the Standard Thermal Model for asteroids.
